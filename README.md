# Overview

Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations.

Prolog.NET provides an implementation of Prolog programming language on the .NET Framework. It includes an enhanced compiler with language extensions and a code generator targeting Microsoftâ€™s Intermediate Language (MSIL).
