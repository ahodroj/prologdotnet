# About

Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations.[4]

Prolog.NET provides an implementation of Prolog programming language on the .NET Framework. It includes an enhanced compiler with language extensions and a code generator targeting Microsoftâ€™s Intermediate Language (MSIL).

# Why Prolog.NET? 

The purpose of this project is to provide seamless integration between .NET and Prolog by compiling Prolog code into reusable .NET objects that leverage the rich feature set provided by the .NET framework. This makes it easy to develop applications that combine the powerful features of both imperative and logic programming paradigms, as well as use logic programming as a meta-language to reason about object-oriented programs.

Prolog.NET was developed by Ali M. Hodroj as a senior capstone project at the Oregon Institute of Technology.
